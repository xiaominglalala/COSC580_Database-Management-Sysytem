# Database-Management-System
Implemented an RDBMS in Python, with Visitor Design Pattern and composite data structures, supporting nearly full SQL syntax, including implicit join, expression updates, and arbitrary expression evaluation for WHERE conditions.
Implemented cost-based and rule-based query optimization, integrity constraints and achieved sub-1-second responsiveness manipulating up to one-million-record tables, which is close to commercial grade.
